On its face, the Rust community looks very American and European. All of its major communication channels and the large majority of its major events are held in English. And yet, English is a minority language. Only a small minority of Rust users have English as their first language. Is it possible to shape Rust towards the world, rather than shape the world to towards Rust? 

Rust's slogan starts with "Empowering everyone", not "Assimilate everyone". And yet, there will be many people who feel excluded from Rust because of its Western viewpoint. 

This talk will raise issues -- as a form of internal self-reflection, rather than from external expertise -- about the Rust project and a few of its major ecosystems. It'll also spend time to describe what you can do to create a more inclusive culture in areas that you control, such as your project and the way to notice that you're being exclusionary. 

Part of this has to do with power. The Rust project is led by a small group of people. The culture that they foster flows into the rest of the ecosystem. Part of this has to do with wealth. The main funders of the Rust project are the world's richest businesses. They consider their contributions to the language to be a strategic investment, and they are generally right. They benefit significantly from their investment in the language.  Part of this has to do with social dynamics. Groups of people work most efficiently when they're very similar. Differences generate conflict. Part of this has to do with the channels that we've decided to use. The Internet created flame wars. Zulip feels different to Discord because they're different systems.Interacting with the same people in a different place leads to a different conversation.

Much of this is unknown. We still have a lot to learn about building a programming language as a group exercise. The Rust community need to become experts in conflict resolution, rather than conflict avoidance. Yes, there are tensions. Collaboration is like that.
