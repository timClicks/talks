## How the course will run

We don't have enough time to learn all of Rust.
Instead we will focus on giving you a core of knowledge that will enable you to expand over time.
We'll also try to use spaced repetition when discussing a complex topic.
Rather than trying to learn the whole concept in one block,
we'll learn part of it and expand upon that over time.
