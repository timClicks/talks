> What is Rust and what's it got to do with data engineering?
> 
> ## Summary
>
> Keen to supercharge your data pipelines? This fun, hands-on session introduces the Rust programming language and will show you how it can support your existing data engineering stack to be more robust and easier to deploy, while processing data faster with fewer compute resources.
>
> - We'll start by introducing Rust for building data transformersâ€”and see that it's possible to get something to run in seconds that takes minutes or more in Python.
> - The next step is integrating Rust within data engineering workflows, from Makefiles to newer tools like Airflow, Mage, Dagster and Prefect. Then we'll discover its secret sauce, deployment. 
> - We'll also see if we can cross-compiling Rust-based data utilities to run on multiple architectures (x86, ARM, WebAssembly/WASM) without needing to worry about dependencies and installation.

> 
> These days, Tim McNamara's attention is focused primarily on supporting teams to adopt Rust - but his software background is actually from data science, Python, and natural language processing. Tim has worked for large internationals such as Amazon Web Services and Canonical, and also local companies like DOT Loves Data and Dragonfly Data Science.
